Artic is a front-end for the AnyDSL compiler framework. Compared to the
existing front-end, Impala, its design is based on different compiler-design
choices. In particular, the type-checking algorithm is based on "Local Type
Inference", by B. Pierce and D. Turner. The focus is on simplicity and ease of
use of the code base, while also trying to optimize the generated code.
